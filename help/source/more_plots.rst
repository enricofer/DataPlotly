Adding other plots
==================
You can add as many plots as you want in the same plot view. Plot types can be
different and also the source layer can be different.

.. note:: results can be very strange depending on the plot type and on the fields you choose. Be careful!

To add other plot just select other fields of the same layer or of a different
layer, customize the plot settings (e.g. changing the color, opacity, etc.) and
add the plot to the basket.
