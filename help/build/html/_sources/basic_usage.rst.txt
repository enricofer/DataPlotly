Data Plotly Interface
=====================
Data Plotly interface has been designed in order to be simple but also complete
with many options and customizations.

Data Plotly has the idea of a *Plot Container* called **Plot Basket** where you
can add just one or as many plots you want.

When you have added all the plots you want in the Plot Basket you can display
the plots in the view.

Data Plotly workflow is pretty straightforward:

1. choose the plot type
2. set the layer and the field you want to plot
3. add the plot(s) to the **Plot Basket**
4. display the plot(s) in the **Plot View**

Adding other plots
------------------
You can add as many plots as you want in the same plot view. Plot types can be
different and also the source layer can be different.

.. note:: results can be very strange depending on the plot type and on the
fields you choose. Be careful!

To add other plot just select other fields of the same layer or of a different
layer, customize the plot settings (e.g. changing the color, opacity, etc.) and
add the plot to the basket.

More instructions are coming soon.
